The following files are needed when parsing rfc.xml with DTD validation.

 - rfc2629.dtd : can be downloaded from
   www.w3.org/2008/xmlsec/Drafts/algorithms-rfc/rfc2629.dtd

 - rfc2629-xhtml.ent : can be downloaded from
   simpleupdateprotocol.googlecode.com/svn-history/r27/trunk/spec/rfc/2629-xhtml.net

 - rfc2629-other.ent : can be donwloaded from
   simpleupdateprotocol.googlecode.com/svn-history/r27/trunk/spec/rfc/2629-other.net

Finally, use Python xml2rfc package to parse rfc.xml. The package can be found 
at:
    
 http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xml2rfc

After downloading all of above documents and packages, running the following 
command will generate .txt and .html files:

 $ xml2rfc rfc.xml -d rfc2629.dtd --raw --html

To parse rfc.xml and generate the .txt and .html files without doing the DTD
validation, run the following script:

 $ sh create_rfc_raw_html.sh
